                        <p>Once a week, I participate in workshops on front-end
                            development. We work on assignments in class to
                            reinforce our learning.

                        <h3> My Contributions</h3>
                        <p>I Inspected websites to identify and understand
                            unfamiliar HTML elements and Researched the
                            functionality of these elements for an assignment
                            provided by the teacher. I creates a square Pokémon
                            using only html and css and with media query on css
                            i made it change colour depending on the screen
                            size. I explored different methods to display data
                            with javascript such as: window.alert(),
                            console.log(), and innerHTML().And Understood the
                            concepts of scope with var, let, and const, and the
                            basics of functions. </p>

                        <p>I modified a tic-tac-to game with javascript to
                            display the cells of the winner player green and to
                            make a gif appear when someone wins. I also made a
                            sound board that when you press a key it plays a
                            sound. And i Also made a Pokémon game using Pokemon
                            API and with the help of chatGPT.</p>

                        <h3>Key Learnings</h3>
                        <p>I learned how to display or change data with
                            javascript using.window.alert(), console.log(), and
                            innerHTML()., I learned the deference between var,
                            let and const. I learned what APIs are and what you
                            can do with them. </p>

                        <h3>Outcome</h3>
                        <p>I believe it has been going alright, i am learning

                            with it and it makes me want to learn more so i can
                            become a developer </p>

                        <h3> My Contributions</h3>
                        <p>After finishing the design of the Wordle page, I
                            moved on to developing it. Creating the HTML and CSS
                            was straightforward because I have good skills in
                            these areas. I didn’t face many issues and could
                            make a nice-looking and functional page. </p>

                        <p>For the JavaScript part, I needed some help since my
                            skills are still developing. I used YouTube
                            tutorials to learn and apply the necessary
                            JavaScript code. These videos were very helpful in
                            guiding me through the process.

                            One important feature I added was a Dictionary API.
                            This checks if the user enters a real word and not
                            just random letters. It helps keep the game
                            challenging and fun by ensuring only valid words are
                            accepted.

                        <h3>Key Learnings</h3>
                        <p>I learned how to create a mini game using HTML, CSS,
                            and JavaScript. Through this process, I deepened my
                            understanding of JavaScript. For example, I learned
                            how to add an event listener that detects when any
                            key is pressed and only counts the action when the
                            key is released. </p>

                        <h3>Outcome</h3>
                        <p>I believe the project went well. I successfully
                            created a functional mini wordle game. Although I
                            encountered some issues with certain aspects of the
                            game, it ultimately worked as intended.</p>
