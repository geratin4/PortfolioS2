                        <p>Once a week, I participate in workshops on front-end
                            development. We work on assignments in class to
                            reinforce our learning.

                    <div class="text-box1">
                        <h3> My Contributions</h3>
                        <p>I Inspected websites to identify and understand
                            unfamiliar HTML elements and Researched the
                            functionality of these elements for an assignment
                            provided by the teacher. I creates a square Pokémon
                            using only html and css and with media query on css
                            i made it change colour depending on the screen
                            size. I explored different methods to display data
                            with javascript such as: window.alert(),
                            console.log(), and innerHTML().And Understood the
                            concepts of scope with var, let, and const, and the
                            basics of functions. </p>

                        <p>I modified a tic-tac-to game with javascript to
                            display the cells of the winner player green and to
                            make a gif appear when someone wins. I also made a
                            sound board that when you press a key it plays a
                            sound. And i Also made a Pokémon game using Pokemon
                            API and with the help of chatGPT.</p>

                        <p>I learned about web accessibility and its importance
                            in creating inclusive websites for everyone,
                            including people with disabilities. Using the WAVE
                            tool, I analyzed a website to assess its
                            accessibility. This exercise helped me understand
                            the key aspects of accessible web design and the
                            steps needed to meet accessibility standards.</p>

                    <div class="text-box1">

                        <h3>Key Learnings</h3>
                        <p>I gained practical JavaScript skills by developing a
                            Tic-Tac-Toe game, adding features like turning the
                            winning player's boxes green, displaying a moving
                            GIF upon a win, and enabling game replay
                            functionality.
                        </p>

                        <p>I learned how to use APIs by creating a mini Pokémon
                            battle game with data from PokeAPI, helping me
                            understand how to fetch and utilize dynamic data in
                            applications.
                        </p>

                        <p>I learned about the importance of web accessibility
                            and how to create inclusive websites for everyone.
                            Using the WAVE tool to analyze a website helped me
                            identify and address accessibility issues.
                        </p>

                        <p>I discovered that VR can be achieved using JavaScript
                            libraries and learned to set up a local server on my
                            laptop to facilitate this, expanding my knowledge of
                            interactive and immersive web technologies.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Outcome</h3>
                        <p>I believe the overall experience went well. Each
                            assignment taught me something valuable for my
                            studies and introduced me to new areas. These
                            experiences enhanced my technical skills and sparked
                            a deeper interest in pursuing a career in
                            development, contributing to my growth and
                            solidifying my passion for this path.</p>

                        <h3> My Contributions</h3>
                        <p>After finishing the design of the Wordle page, I
                            moved on to developing it. Creating the HTML and CSS
                            was straightforward because I have good skills in
                            these areas. I didn’t face many issues and could
                            make a nice-looking and functional page. </p>

                        <p>For the JavaScript part, I needed some help since my
                            skills are still developing. I used YouTube
                            tutorials to learn and apply the necessary
                            JavaScript code. These videos were very helpful in
                            guiding me through the process.

                            One important feature I added was a Dictionary API.
                            This checks if the user enters a real word and not
                            just random letters. It helps keep the game
                            challenging and fun by ensuring only valid words are
                            accepted.

                        <h3>Key Learnings</h3>
                        <p>I learned how to create a mini game using HTML, CSS,
                            and JavaScript. Through this process, I deepened my
                            understanding of JavaScript. For example, I learned
                            how to add an event listener that detects when any
                            key is pressed and only counts the action when the
                            key is released. </p>

                        <h3>Outcome</h3>
                        <p>I believe the project went well. I successfully
                            created a functional mini wordle game. Although I
                            encountered some issues with certain aspects of the
                            game, it ultimately worked as intended.</p>

                        <p>For my final project this semester, I chose to
                            develop a webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to
                            deepen my development skills. I created a website
                            showcasing diverse art cultures from different
                            countries and regions worldwide.</p>

                        <h3> My Contributions</h3>
                        <p>I developed a website showcasing different art
                            cultures worldwide. I added a 3D globe on the
                            homepage that spins and moves with the cursor
                            . For development, I used JavaScript,
                            Node.js, Three.js, GSAP, and Vite. </p>

                        <p>I installed Node.js to manage dependencies and used
                            Three.js to create a 3D sphere, set up a scene, and
                            add a camera for rendering. I applied shaders and
                            textures to make the sphere look like Earth,
                            defining shaders in a GLSL file and importing them
                            into JavaScript.

                            With GSAP, I added mouse movement functionality,
                            making the 3D globe follow the cursor and rotate. I
                            used Vite as a local server to facilitate
                            development and testing.

                        <p>I learned how to work with Three.js, including

                            modifying values. I also added textures, colors, and
                            shaders to objects by creating GLSL files and
                            integrating them into JavaScript. Additionally, I
                            gained experience with Vite for local hosting, which
                            streamlined development with its fast build times
                            and hot module replacement. This hands-on experience
                            provided insights into modern development tools and
                            techniques, helping me effectively combine various
                            technologies to create interactive and visually
