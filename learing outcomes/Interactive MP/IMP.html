                    <h2>Project Branding</h2>
                    <p>For this project, I collaborated with three teammates to rebrand an artist's brand. Our goal was to increase her exposure and enhance her online presence. My primary roles were website design, documentation, and research</p>

                    <h3> My Contributions</h3>
                    <P>Me and my group  conducted a research to learn more about  working class people that are interested in art, 
                        this was our target group. For the research I did physical interviews, these interviews were conducted in places where we could find our target audience such as: a cafe, 
                        furniture store and Van pier book store. These interviews helped me on on how i should brand the artists brand to reach the target audience. </P>

                    <p>I designed the website for the client. the client requested a minimalistic look with pastel colors and I also designed an instagram mock up on h0w she could rebrand her instagram to bring more attention to her instagram.  </p>

                <h3>Key Learnings</h3>
                <p>I learned the importance of refining target audience research methods. Initially, we planned a broad survey, We wanted to make a Qr code to a survey and let any people fill it in, but feedback from teachers helped us focus to target specific demographics that would give us valuable data for our research and to do physical interviews than an online survey. </p>
                <p>I learned the value of creative thinking and suggesting out-of-the-box ideas to clients. I designed the website in a way it will fulfill the client requests, but the client like more a website that did not really fit any of the requirement of the client </p>

                <h3>Outcome</h3>
                <p>The project received positive feedback from our teachers, particularly for our effective interview strategy and innovative design approach.The client liked the simplicity of the website and the easy navigation.</p>

                    <p>I came with ideas on how we should market the website. Based of the research the best way to market the website was through social media. I came with the ideas to make short engaging videos that would promote the website.  </p>

                    <p>For this project, I worked with the same client as in project 2. This time, my role involved development instead of marketing. In pairs, we developed easter eggs for the website. My responsibilities included research, design, and development.</p>

                    <h3> My Contributions</h3>
                    <P>
                        For this project, I also conducted research to understand how international students feel about discovering Easter eggs on the Explore Breda website.
                         This research was carried out through a survey that I distributed to international students. The survey results provided valuable insights: most international students feel neutral or very excited about finding Easter eggs. Additionally,
                          the survey revealed which types of Easter eggs are most appealing to them. </P>

                    <p> I also came up with the idea to add Wordle as a mini-game Easter egg. To implement this, I designed the Easter egg page, ensuring the design was simple and cohesive with the rest of the website. 
                        My goal was to create a seamless user experience by maintaining a consistent aesthetic. The straightforward design not only aligned with the website's existing look and feel but also ensured that users could easily engage with the game without any distractions. This approach helped to integrate the mini-game smoothly into the overall website experience.</p>

                <h3>Key Learnings</h3>
                <p>Designing the Wordle mini-game taught me how to balance simplicity with user engagement.

                <h3>Outcome</h3>
                <p> I got good feedback from teachers and my classmates for The mini-game design. They also really liked the idea to make wordle as a mini-game, since most of them are familiar with the game and find it fun </p>
