                        <h2>Project Branding</h2>
                        <p>For this project, I collaborated with three teammates
                            to rebrand an artist's brand. Our goal was to
                            increase her exposure and enhance her online
                            presence. My primary roles were website design,
                            documentation, and research</p>

                        <h3> My Contributions</h3>
                        <p>Me and my group conducted a research to learn more
                            about working class people that are interested in
                            art,
                            this was our target group. For the research I did
                            physical interviews, these interviews were conducted
                            in places where we could find our target audience
                            such as: a cafe,
                            furniture store and Van pier book store. These
                            interviews helped me on on how i should brand the
                            artists brand to reach the target audience. </p>

                        <p>I designed the website for the client. the client
                            requested a minimalistic look with pastel colors and
                            I also designed an instagram mock up on h0w she
                            could rebrand her instagram to bring more attention
                            to her instagram. </p>

                        <h3>Key Learnings</h3>
                        <p>I learned the importance of refining target audience
                            research methods. Initially, we planned a broad
                            survey, We wanted to make a Qr code to a survey and
                            let any people fill it in, but feedback from
                            teachers helped us focus to target specific
                            demographics that would give us valuable data for
                            our research and to do physical interviews than an
                            online survey. </p>
                        <p>I learned the value of creative thinking and
                            suggesting out-of-the-box ideas to clients. I
                            designed the website in a way it will fulfill the
                            client requests, but the client like more a website
                            that did not really fit any of the requirement of
                            the client </p>

                        <h3>Outcome</h3>
                        <p>The project received positive feedback from our
                            teachers, particularly for our effective interview
                            strategy and innovative design approach.The client
                            liked the simplicity of the website and the easy
                            navigation.</p>

                            to the website. I worked in a group of 4 people to
                            build the marketing strategy for the website</p>

                        <p>I conducted research to find out how we should market
                            the website to international students, which was our
                            target group.The research was done through a survey
                            that we asked international students/students to
                            fill in. the survey helped answering the main
                            question which is “What are international students
                            interested in when visiting a new city?” and helped
                            us knowing where we should market the website. </p>

                            market the website was through social media. I came
                            with the ideas to make short engaging videos that
                            would promote the website. </p>

                        <p>I learned to do research based on survey and how to
                            implement it in marketing strategies. I learned how
                            to do videos strategies for marketing. </p>

                        <h3>Outcome</h3>
                        <p>The project received positive feedback from our
                            teachers and client. The research was well done to
                            help us with the marketing and the client really
                            like the videos and the posters that were made for

                        <p>For this project, I worked with the same client as in
                            project 2. This time, my role involved development
                            instead of marketing. In pairs, we developed easter
                            eggs for the website. My responsibilities included
                            research, design, and development.</p>

                        <h3> My Contributions</h3>
                        <p>
                            For this project, I also conducted research to
                            understand how international students feel about
                            discovering Easter eggs on the Explore Breda
                            website.
                            This research was carried out through a survey that
                            I distributed to international students. The survey
                            results provided valuable insights: most
                            international students feel neutral or very excited
                            about finding Easter eggs. Additionally,
                            the survey revealed which types of Easter eggs are
                            most appealing to them. </p>

                        <p> I also came up with the idea to add Wordle as a
                            mini-game Easter egg. To implement this, I designed
                            the Easter egg page, ensuring the design was simple
                            and cohesive with the rest of the website.
                            My goal was to create a seamless user experience by
                            maintaining a consistent aesthetic. The
                            straightforward design not only aligned with the
                            website's existing look and feel but also ensured
                            that users could easily engage with the game without
                            any distractions. This approach helped to integrate
                            the mini-game smoothly into the overall website
                            experience.</p>

                        <h3>Key Learnings</h3>
                        <p>Designing the Wordle mini-game taught me how to
                            balance simplicity with user engagement.
                            By maintaining a straightforward design, I created
                            an enjoyable experience that seamlessly fits within
                            the existing website framework.</p>

                        <h3>Outcome</h3>
                        <p> I got good feedback from teachers and my classmates
                            for The mini-game design. They also really liked the
                            idea to make wordle as a mini-game, since most of
                            them are familiar with the game and find it fun </p>

                        <p>
                            While creating my portfolio, I conducted user
                            testing to ensure it was easy to navigate and
                            understand. I tested it with four users, assigning
                            them three tasks: find the learning outcomes, locate
                            the PDFs of the learning outcomes, and return to the
                            main learning outcomes page. After each task, I
                            asked the users questions to gather feedback and
                            identify areas for improvement, aiming to make my
                            portfolio as user-friendly and clear as possible

                        <p>I learned that doing user testing is important. For
                            my previous project, I did not really do any user
                            testing in this way. This user testing was crucial
                            for my portfolio; I made it clearer and easier to
                            navigate.</p>

                        <h3>Outcome</h3>
                        <p> I believe the user testing went well. I received
                            valuable feedback from the users, and by
                            incorporating their suggestions, I was able to make
                            adjustments to my portfolio, resulting in a more
                            user-friendly and easier-to-navigate experience.</p>

                        <p>For my final project this semester, I chose to
                            develop a webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to
                            deepen my development skills. I created a website
                            showcasing diverse art cultures from different
                            countries and regions worldwide.</p>

                        <h3> My Contributions</h3>
                        <p>
                            For this project, I conducted user testing for my
                            website using paper prototypes to evaluate
                            navigation clarity and button placements. I tested
                            with three users, assigning tasks like navigating to
                            the Japan page, moving to another country’s page,
                            and returning to the home page. After
                            each task, I gathered detailed feedback. This
                            approach helped me understand users' experiences and
                            identify areas for improvement.

                        <h3>Key Learnings</h3>
                        <p>I learned to conduct user testing with paper
                            prototypes to optimize website navigation and
                            design. This provided insights into user
                            interactions, helping identify areas for
                            improvement. Observing users' navigation gave me a
                            better understanding of their needs, emphasizing the
                            importance of iterative testing and feedback for
                            user-friendly websites.</p>

                        <h3>Outcome</h3>
                        <p> I believe it went well. User testing feedback
                            indicated that the navigation and page layout were
                            very clear, so I didn't need to make significant
                            changes. This positive feedback confirmed that the
                            initial design effectively met user needs.</p>
