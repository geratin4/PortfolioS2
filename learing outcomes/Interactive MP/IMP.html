                    <h2>Project Branding</h2>
                    <p>For this project, I collaborated with three teammates to rebrand an artist's brand. Our goal was to increase her exposure and enhance her online presence. My primary roles were website design, documentation, and research</p>

                    <h3> My Contributions</h3>
                    <P>Me and my group  conducted a research to learn more about  working class people that are interested in art, 
                        this was our target group. For the research I did physical interviews, these interviews were conducted in places where we could find our target audience such as: a cafe, 
                        furniture store and Van pier book store. These interviews helped me on on how i should brand the artists brand to reach the target audience. </P>

                    <p>I designed the website for the client. the client requested a minimalistic look with pastel colors and I also designed an instagram mock up on h0w she could rebrand her instagram to bring more attention to her instagram.  </p>

                <h3>Key Learnings</h3>
                <p>I learned the importance of refining target audience research methods. Initially, we planned a broad survey, We wanted to make a Qr code to a survey and let any people fill it in, but feedback from teachers helped us focus to target specific demographics that would give us valuable data for our research and to do physical interviews than an online survey. </p>
                <p>I learned the value of creative thinking and suggesting out-of-the-box ideas to clients. I designed the website in a way it will fulfill the client requests, but the client like more a website that did not really fit any of the requirement of the client </p>

                <h3>Outcome</h3>
                <p>The project received positive feedback from our teachers, particularly for our effective interview strategy and innovative design approach.The client liked the simplicity of the website and the easy navigation.</p>

                    <p>For the second Project I got the assignment to make a marketing strategy for the Company hand-picked.

                    <h3> My Contributions</h3>
                    <P>I conducted research to find out how we should market the website to international students, which was our target group.The research was done through a survey that we asked international students/students to fill in. the survey helped answering the main question which is “What are international students interested in when visiting a new city?” and helped us knowing where we should market the website.  </P>

                    <p>I came with ideas on how we should market the website. Based of the research the best way to market the website was through social media. I came with the ideas to make short engaging videos that would promote the website.  </p>
