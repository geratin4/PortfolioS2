                        <h2>Project Branding</h2>
                        <p>For this project, I collaborated with three teammates
                            to rebrand an artist's brand. Our goal was to
                            increase her exposure and enhance her online
                            presence. My primary roles were website design,
                            documentation, and research</p>

                    <div class="text-box1">
                        <h3> My Contributions</h3>
                        <p>For this project, my team and I conducted a video
                            call with the client to ask questions and
                            demonstrate our progress. This
                            allowed us to receive immediate feedback and ensure
                            we were aligned with the client's expectations.
                        </p>

                        <p> Additionally, we created a Notion group where we
                            organized our weekly plans and sprint schedules.</p>

                        <h3>Key Learnings</h3>
                        <p>I've learned to work effectively within a team,
                            efficiently dividing tasks and collaborating towards
                            a common goal. Regular client meetings have been
                            crucial for updating progress and understanding
                            their preferences. These experiences taught me the
                            importance of clear communication, adaptability, and
                            continuous feedback for successful project outcomes.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Outcome</h3>
                        <p>I believe the project went well overall. We
                            maintained good communication with the client,
                            crucial for understanding her needs and preferences.
                            I effectively completed my tasks and received
                            valuable support from my group members. This
                            collaborative effort ensured we stayed on track and
                            delivered a successful outcome. </p>

                            (explorebreda.nl) and they needed to bring traffic
                            to the website. I worked in a group of 4 people to
                            build the marketing strategy for the website</p>

                        <h3> My Contributions</h3>
                        <p>For this project, I used Notion as our planning tool,
                            collaborating closely with my group. We organized
                            the project into two sprints, each with a detailed
                            list of tasks and assigned responsibilities. We
                            tracked each task’s progress in Notion, keeping
                            everyone informed of their roles and the project's
                            status.
                        </p>

                        <p> Despite facing health challenges, I remained
                            committed and continued to contribute my best
                            effort. Even while feeling unwell, I traveled to
                            Breda in rainy, cold weather to shoot the videos,
                            demonstrating my dedication and professional

                        <p>Throughout this project, I learned to effectively
                            work in sprints and use Notion as a planning tool.
                            This experience highlighted the importance of
                            breaking down the project into manageable phases and
                            organizing tasks systematically, enhancing our

                        <h3>Outcome</h3>
                        <p>I believe it went well. Using Notion helped
                            streamline our workflow, maintain clear
                            communication within the team, and ensure that all

                        <h2>Project Development </h2>
                        <p>For this project, I worked with the same client as in
                            project 2. This time, my role involved development
                            instead of marketing. In pairs, we developed easter
                            eggs for the website. My responsibilities included
                            research, design, and development.</p>

                        <h3> My Contributions</h3>
                        <p>My group partner and I used Notion to organize our
                            workflow into two sprints. Sprint one focused on
                            brainstorming ideas, conducting research, and
                            creating designs for the Easter eggs. Sprint two was
                            dedicated to their development. We
                            also used a Git repository for collaborative
                            development. This structured
                            approach allowed us to efficiently manage tasks and
                            ensure a smooth progression from conceptualization
                            to execution.

                        <h3>Key Learnings</h3>
                        <p>I learned to work in short sprints and collaborate
                            effectively in a duo. This was a new experience for
                            me, as my previous group projects typically involved
                            working with five people. Adapting to this smaller
                            team dynamic and using shorter sprints helped me
                            develop new skills in project management and
                            teamwork.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Outcome</h3>
                        <p>I believe the project went well, as I worked
                            effectively with my partner. Using a Git repository
                            for version control was also successful, with no
                            issues encountered. Overall, the collaboration and
                            technical aspects of the project proceeded smoothly
