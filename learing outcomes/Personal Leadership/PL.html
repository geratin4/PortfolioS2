                            increase her exposure and enhance her online
                            presence. My primary roles were website design,

                        <h3> My Contributions</h3>
                        <p>This semester, I actively sought feedback on my
                            designs and projects (see Figure 8). I also kept up
                            with design trends by watching YouTube videos and
                            following influencers on social media who share
                            media design content. This continuous learning
                            approach helps me stay updated with the latest
                            developments in my field.

                        </p>

                        <p> I participated in a workshop with a unique
                            assignment where I wrote down what I believed my
                            core values were and then asked my classmates for
                            their input on what they thought my core values
                            were. After gathering their feedback, I identified
                            three frequently mentioned values: creativity,
                            honesty, and stylishness. This exercise was
                            enlightening and helped me gain a clearer
                            understanding of my personal values.</p>

                        <p> Additionally, I completed a personality test from
                            16Personalities as part of another assignment. The
                            test provided insights into my personality traits,
                            which I compared with those of others in my group
                            (see Figure 10). This comparison allowed me to
                            better understand my strengths and areas for
                            improvement in a group setting.</p>

                        <p> Outside of school, I am dedicated to furthering my
                            knowledge in development by taking free online
                            courses on platforms like Udemy, focusing on
                            front-end and full-stack development. Additionally,
                            I attend job fairs and career events related to my
                            studies. These activities provide valuable
                            networking opportunities and insights into potential
                            career paths.</p>

                        <h3>Key Learnings</h3>
                        <p>Asking for feedback has provided me with new ideas
                            and perspectives, ensuring I'm on the right track
                            and fulfilling objectives. Through this process, I
                            learned my core values according to my classmates:
                            creativity, honesty, and 'stylishness.
                        </p>

                        <p>Taking a personality test was enlightening. It helped
                            me understand my strengths and weaknesses, crucial
                            for future group projects. Knowing these aspects
                            allows me to contribute more effectively and focus
                            on areas for improvement. </p>

                        <p>Additionally, I have been exploring various career
                            paths that align with my studies. This process of
                            discovery has been both exciting and overwhelming,
                            as I am still uncertain about the exact direction I
                            want to pursue. However, this exploration is helping
                            me narrow down my options and find a path that truly
                            resonates with my interests and skills. </p>

                        <h3>Outcome</h3>
                        <p>I believe it went well. I gained valuable knowledge
                            about my study path and potential career
                            opportunities, providing clearer insights into my
                            future direction. This experience boosted my
                            confidence in navigating my career journey.
                            Recognizing my strengths and weaknesses has helped
                            me leverage my problem-solving skills and
                            adaptability, making me more effective in my studies
                            and future career. This self-awareness has guided my
                            personal and professional growth. </p>
