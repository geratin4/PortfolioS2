                        <h2>Project Branding</h2>
                        <p>For this project, I collaborated with three teammates
                            to rebrand an artist's brand. Our goal was to
                            increase her exposure and enhance her online
                            presence. My primary roles were website design,
                            documentation, and research</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="text-box1">
                        <h3> My Contributions</h3>
                        <p>I looked into different pastel colors pallet, because
                            the client wanted pastel colors for her brand and
                            fonts that I could use for the brad. I made some
                            styles capes with these paster colors and fonts, to
                            show case the client what sort of colors and
                            typography I wanted to use for her brand. I went
                            through different iterations for the styles capes
                            after asking on feedback to the teachers. </p>

                        <p>I also designed the website for the client. before I
                            started the website design, I looked for
                            minimalistic websites for inspiration. I also looked
                            at other artist webpages to get inspiration on how
                            to lay-out the website. I went through iterations of
                            the website design after asking on feedback to the
                            teachers. </p>

                        <h3>Key Learnings</h3>
                        <p>I learned how to layout your content, not to mix
                            sharp edges with smooth edges and staying away from
                            plain white backgrounds, which make a design look
                            cheap. </p>
                        <p>I learned also to create various website design so i
                            can ask feedback and could improve them to a nice
                            appealing website. </p>

                        <h3>Outcome</h3>
                        <p>The project received positive feedback from our
                            teachers, particularly for our effective interview
                            strategy and innovative design approach.The client
                            liked the simplicity of the website and the easy
                            navigation.</p>

                            marketing strategy for the Company hand-picked. They
                            launched a brand-new website for the city of Breda
                            (explorebreda.nl) and they needed to bring traffic
                            to the website. I worked in a group of 4 people to
                            build the marketing strategy for the website</p>

                        <h3> My Contributions</h3>
                        <p>I came with videos ideas to market the website
                            through social media. From the research I gathered
                            that we needed to market the website via social
                            media since that is the preferred source of
                            information for international students. </p>

                        <p>I shot and directed the funny videos that promote the
                            website and I also color-graded one of the videos to
                            make it look more professional. I went to some
                            iterations on the color grading after asking people
                            for feedback. </p>

                            videos and they said it was a nice way to approach
                            our target audience. I also feel like I did not do a
                            lot for this learning outcome. I believe I could
                            have done more, but because of health issues I could
                            give my 100</p>

                        <h2>Project development </h2>
                        <p>For this project, I worked with the same client as in
                            project 2. This time, my role involved development
                            instead of marketing. In pairs, we developed easter
                            eggs for the website. My responsibilities included
                            research, design, and development.</p>

                    <div class="text-box1">
                        <h3> My Contributions</h3>
                        <p> For this project, I designed the page for the mini
                            Wordle game. I did not go through many iterations; I
                            created four different designs, varying only in
                            colour. </p>

                        <p> Additionally, I created a 3D
                            animation of the Explore Breda logo using Blender.
                            This 3D model was intended for use as a VR object,
                            allowing users to see the 3D logo spin when they
                            scan an image on the website. </p>

                        <h3>Key Learnings</h3>
                        <p>I have learned to use several features of Blender,
                            particularly how to animate within the software. I
                            discovered that it's possible to import SVG
                            illustrations and utilise them as sculptures, which
                            opens up a variety of creative possibilities for
                            integrating detailed vector graphics into 3D
                            animations. </p>

                        <h3>Outcome</h3>
                        <p>I believe the project went quite well overall. I
                            received positive feedback from both teachers and
                            classmates regarding the Easter eggs I showcased.
