                    <h2>Project Branding</h2>
                    <p>For this project, I collaborated with three teammates to rebrand an artist's brand. Our goal was to increase her exposure and enhance her online presence. My primary roles were website design, documentation, and research</p>

                <div class="text-box1">
                    <h3> My Contributions</h3>
                    <P>I looked into different pastel colors pallet, because the client wanted pastel colors for her brand  and fonts that I could use for the brad. I made some styles capes with these paster colors and fonts, to show case the client what sort of colors and typography I wanted to use for her brand. I went through different iterations for the styles capes after asking on feedback to the teachers. </P>

                    <p>I also designed the website for the client. before  I started the website design, I looked for  minimalistic websites for inspiration. I also looked at other artist webpages to get inspiration on how to lay-out the website. I went through iterations of the website design after asking on feedback to the teachers.  </p>

                <h3>Key Learnings</h3>
                <p>I learned how to layout your content, not to mix sharp edges with smooth edges and staying away from plain white backgrounds, which make a design look cheap. </p>
                <p>I learned also to create various website design so i can ask feedback and could improve them to a nice appealing website. </p>

                <h3>Outcome</h3>
                <p>The project received positive feedback from our teachers, particularly for our effective interview strategy and innovative design approach.The client liked the simplicity of the website and the easy navigation.</p>

                    <p>For the second Project I got the assignment to make a marketing strategy for the Company hand-picked. They launched a brand-new website for the city of Breda (explorebreda.nl) and they needed to bring traffic to the website. I worked in a group of 4 people to build the marketing strategy for the website</p>

                    <h3> My Contributions</h3>
                    <P>I  came with videos ideas to market the website through social media. From the research I gathered that we needed to market the website via social media since that is the preferred source of information for international students.   </P>

                    <p>I shot and directed the funny videos that promote the website and I also color-graded one of the videos to make it look more professional. I  went to some iterations on the color grading after asking people for feedback. </p>

                <h3>Key Learnings</h3>
                <p> learned how to use Adobe Premiere Pro to color grade videos and export them in high quality for posting on social media. </p>
            
                <h3>Outcome</h3>
                <p>I believe it went well, the client really liked the videos and they said it was a nice way to approach our target audience. I also feel like I did not do a lot for this learning outcome. I believe I could have done more, but because of health issues I could give my 100</p>
